FastAPI is a powerful and modern web framework for building APIs with Python. Here are some key concepts and features you should be familiar with:

FastAPI Basics:

Routing: Define API endpoints using decorators like @app.get(), @app.post(), etc.
Dependency Injection: Use Depends to manage dependencies and inject them into your routes.
Data Validation: Use Pydantic models to validate request data and generate documentation.
Request and Response Handling:

Path Parameters: Extract values from the URL path.
Query Parameters: Handle optional parameters in the URL.
Request Bodies: Parse and validate JSON request bodies using Pydantic models.
Response Models: Define and validate response data using Pydantic models.
Asynchronous Support:

Async Functions: Use async def for defining asynchronous route handlers.
Concurrency: Handle concurrent requests efficiently with async I/O operations.
Dependency Injection:

Dependency Functions: Create reusable components and inject them into routes using Depends.
Dependency Overriding: Override dependencies for testing or different environments.
Security:

Authentication: Implement authentication mechanisms like OAuth2, JWT, or Basic Auth.
Authorization: Use dependency injection to enforce permissions and roles.
Middleware:

Custom Middleware: Add custom middleware to process requests and responses globally.
Error Handling:

Exception Handling: Use FastAPI's exception handlers to catch and handle errors.
Custom Exception Classes: Create custom exception classes and handle them with HTTPException.
OpenAPI and Swagger:

Automatic Documentation: FastAPI generates interactive API documentation with Swagger UI and ReDoc.
Customizing Documentation: Customize the generated documentation with metadata and examples.
Testing:

Test Client: Use FastAPIâ€™s TestClient for writing unit tests for your API endpoints.
Testing Dependencies: Test dependencies by injecting mock objects.
Database Integration:

SQLAlchemy: Integrate with SQL databases using SQLAlchemy.
Tortoise ORM: Use Tortoise ORM for async database interactions.
MongoDB: Use libraries like motor or beanie for MongoDB integration.
Deployment:

ASGI Servers: Deploy FastAPI applications using ASGI servers like Uvicorn or Daphne.
Containerization: Use Docker for containerizing and deploying FastAPI applications.
Performance:

Speed: FastAPI is designed for high performance, leveraging async capabilities and automatic data validation.
Efficiency: Minimize latency and resource usage by leveraging FastAPI's built-in optimizations.
